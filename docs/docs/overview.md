### ðŸ“Œ Overview: Creating a Custom VPC and Accessing Windows Server on AWS  ###

This project focuses on **building a custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** in AWS with a structured network setup, including **public and private subnets, route tables, an Internet Gateway (IGW), and security groups**. A **Windows Server EC2 instance** is deployed in the public subnet, configured with appropriate **security rules and routing**, and accessed using **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**. The setup ensures secure network segmentation while allowing controlled access to the instance. Additionally, internet connectivity is tested to validate the network configuration. ðŸš€

Key Objectives
âœ… Custom VPC Setup: Create a dedicated network environment.

âœ… Subnet Configuration: Set up public and private subnets.

âœ… Internet Gateway & Routing: Enable internet access via a public subnet.

âœ… Security Group Setup: Restrict and allow access as needed.

âœ… EC2 Windows Server Deployment: Launch an instance inside the VPC.

âœ… Remote Desktop Access: Connect to the Windows instance via RDP.

âœ… Internet Connectivity Test: Verify outbound traffic from the instance.
