Project Title: "Creating a Custom VPC and Accessing Windows Server on AWS"

Project Description:

### ** Creating a Custom VPC and Accessing Windows Server on AWS**  

The goal of this project is to **design and deploy a fully functional Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** in AWS, ensuring secure and efficient network communication. This VPC setup will provide a controlled environment for hosting resources, such as an **Amazon EC2 Windows Server**, while implementing **best practices for security and networking**.  

### **Key Objectives:**  
âœ… **Custom VPC Creation** â€“ Set up an isolated AWS network with **IPv4 CIDR** configuration.  
âœ… **Subnets Configuration** â€“ Create **Public and Private Subnets** to separate internet-facing and internal resources.  
âœ… **Internet & NAT Gateway** â€“ Enable **internet access** for public instances while securing private ones.  
âœ… **Route Tables & Association** â€“ Manage traffic flow between subnets using **custom route tables**.  
âœ… **Security Groups & NACLs** â€“ Control inbound and outbound traffic to enhance **network security**.  
âœ… **Windows Server Deployment** â€“ Launch a **Windows EC2 instance** in the public subnet and enable RDP access.  
âœ… **Bastion Host Setup (Optional)** â€“ Improve security by restricting direct access to private resources. 



This project will provide hands-on experience in **AWS networking, security, and infrastructure automation**, making it an ideal learning opportunity for **Cloud and DevOps Engineers**. ðŸš€
